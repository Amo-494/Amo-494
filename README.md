- 👋 Hi, I’m Kipkirui Amos 
- 👀 I’m a solution-focused developer.
     I'm passionate about full-stack web development 
     and app development. I recently worked with Chpter ltd
     as a backend developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build an Instagram clone 
     and WhatsApp clone using flutter & firebase.
     I also intend to implement some API with Restframework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real world projects and also 
     make contributions on open source projects.
